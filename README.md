Emacs
===========================================

Uses `borg.el`
---------------

[Borg] is a bare-bones package manager for Emacs packages.  It
provides only a few essential features and should be combined with
other tools such as Magit, `epkg`, `use-package`, and `auto-compile`.

Borg assimilates packages into the `~/.emacs.d` repository as Git
submodules.  An assimilated package is called a drone and a borg-based
`~/.emacs.d` repository is called a collective.
